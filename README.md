# Glasses Voltmeter
This project is actually still a prototype. This device can calculate DC voltage or direct voltage on a resource in an electronic circuit equipped with glasses that are worn in such a way so by using this tool can be more effective, efficient and comfortable when used. This tool will detect the electrical voltage that goes through the Black Housing Male which is located on the voltmeter. There are two Black Housing Male namely Black Housing Male positive which will later be placed on the source of the positive pole and the Black Housing Male negative which is placed on the negative pole source. Data taken from the Black Housing Male will enter the Arduino Uno. Arduino Uno then sends data to the glasses section with a Bluetooth module and the data will be received on Arduino Pro Micro with a Bluetooth module found in the glasses section. Data will be displayed in both parts, the voltmeter will be displayed on the LCD while the glasses will be displayed on OLED where OLED light will be reflected towards transparent glass.


## Installation
Make sure you already setup your Bluetooth on both side and setup your OLED.


## Schematic
This is my schematic from both section. I'm using [Fritzing](https://fritzing.org/home/).
